# Peatland-SIP-16S-Pipeline
A reproducible bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from peatland stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments. The workflow processes paired-end reads from primer trimming through denoising, taxonomy, phylogeny, differential abundance, and quantitative SIP analysis.
